This project focuses on implementing an Internet of Things (IoT) system using **NodeMCU**, **Firebase**, and a **password requirement**. The system enables remote control of an electrical circuit through a user interface accessible from a distance while ensuring secure access control. The project uses NodeMCU, an open-source IoT platform, to establish a connection between the circuit and the internet, Firebase, a cloud-based database service, to store and retrieve data related to the circuit, and a password requirement to prevent unauthorized access to the circuit. The user interface allows the user to monitor and control the circuit remotely through a web interface accessible on any device with an internet connection. The project demonstrates the potential of IoT technologies to enable remote control and monitoring of electrical systems while ensuring the security of the system. Overall, this project showcases the practical applications of IoT and its potential to enhance the functionality, accessibility, and security of electrical systems.
